UPROPERTY is a macro used in Unreal Engine's C++ programming language to define a property for a class. 
It is used to specify the attributes of a member variable, such as how it should be displayed in the editor, how it should be saved or loaded,
and whether it should be replicated across the network for multiplayer games.

UPROPERTY can be used to specify various attributes, such as : 
EditAnywhere       (allows the property to be edited in the editor),
BlueprintReadWrite (allows the property to be accessed and modified from Blueprint), 
BlueprintReadOnly  (allows the property to be accessed but not modified from Blueprint), -and-
Replicated         (indicates that the property should be replicated across the network).

An example of how UPROPERTY can be used:

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
UCLASS()
class AMyActor : public AActor
{
  GENERATED_BODY()

public:
  UPROPERTY(EditAnywhere, BlueprintReadWrite, Category = "MyActor")
  float MyFloat;
};
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This code defines a class called AMyActor that inherits from AActor. 
It has a public member variable called MyFloat, which is decorated with the UPROPERTY macro.
This property is editable in the editor and can be accessed and modified in Blueprint.
