In computer programming, a macro is a set of instructions or a code fragment that is given a name and can be invoked multiple times throughout the code. 
Macros are often used to simplify repetitive or complex code structures, making it easier to write and maintain code.

In C++, macros are defined using the #define preprocessor directive. 
A macro definition typically consists of a name and a body of code that will be executed whenever the macro is called. 


For example:
----------------------------------------
#define MAX(a,b) ((a) > (b) ? (a) : (b))
----------------------------------------

This macro defines a function-like macro named MAX that takes two arguments and returns the maximum of the two.
The body of the macro is enclosed in parentheses and uses the ternary operator to perform the comparison.

Macros can be very powerful, but they can also be misused and can lead to hard-to-debug errors if not used carefully. 
It is important to understand the scope and behavior of macros in order to use them effectively.

In Unreal Engine, the UPROPERTY macro is used extensively to define properties of objects in C++. 
It is used to specify the behavior of the property, such as its visibility in the editor, 
how it should be serialized, and whether it should be replicated across the network in multiplayer games.
