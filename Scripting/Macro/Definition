In computer programming, a macro is a set of instructions or a code fragment that is given a name and can be invoked multiple times throughout the code. 
Macros are often used to simplify repetitive or complex code structures, making it easier to write and maintain code.

In C++, macros are defined using the #define preprocessor directive. 
A macro definition typically consists of a name and a body of code that will be executed whenever the macro is called. 


For example:
----------------------------------------
#define MAX(a,b) ((a) > (b) ? (a) : (b))
----------------------------------------

This macro defines a function-like macro named MAX that takes two arguments and returns the maximum of the two.
The body of the macro is enclosed in parentheses and uses the ternary operator to perform the comparison.

Macros can be very powerful, but they can also be misused and can lead to hard-to-debug errors if not used carefully. 
It is important to understand the scope and behavior of macros in order to use them effectively.

In Unreal Engine, the UPROPERTY macro is used extensively to define properties of objects in C++. 
It is used to specify the behavior of the property, such as its visibility in the editor, 
how it should be serialized, and whether it should be replicated across the network in multiplayer games.

Some of the commonly used static macros in Unreal Engine:

UCLASS()                             - Used to define a class that can be used in the Unreal Editor and can be instantiated in-game.
UFUNCTION()                          - Used to define a function that can be called from UnrealScript or Blueprints.
UPROPERTY()                          - Used to declare a property that can be edited in the Unreal Editor.
UENUM()                              - Used to define an enumeration that can be used in UnrealScript or Blueprints.
USTRUCT()                            - Used to define a custom structure that can be used in UnrealScript or Blueprints.
DECLARE_EVENT()                      - Used to declare an event that can be broadcast and bound to from Blueprint.
DECLARE_INTERFACE()                  - Used to declare an interface that can be implemented by classes.
DECLARE_LOG_CATEGORY_EXTERN()        - Used to declare a log category that can be used for logging.
DECLARE_DYNAMIC_MULTICAST_DELEGATE() - Used to declare a multicast delegate that can be bound to and invoked from Blueprint.

These are just a few examples of the many static macros used in Unreal Engine. 
Each macro has a specific purpose and usage, and they are all designed to make development easier and more efficient.
