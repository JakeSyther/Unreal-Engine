Introduction :

Unreal Engine is a popular game development engine that uses C++ as its primary programming language. 
In order to optimize the performance of games and other applications built using Unreal Engine,
developers need to make use of various techniques to minimize the amount of time spent on processing and memory allocation.
One such technique is to use inlining, which can significantly reduce the overhead associated with function calls.

In Unreal Engine, the "FORCEINLINE" macro is used to suggest to the compiler that a particular function should be inlined. 
In this article, we'll discuss what inlining is, why it's important for game development, and how the FORCEINLINE macro works in Unreal Engine. 
We'll also provide some examples to illustrate how the FORCEINLINE macro can be used in practice.

What is inlining?

Inlining is a technique used by compilers to optimize code by replacing function calls with the actual code of the function. 
When a function is inlined, the function call is replaced with the function body, which can reduce the overhead associated with function calls.
Inlined functions are typically small, with a few lines of code, and are called frequently.

Inlining can result in faster code execution, since there is no overhead associated with function calls. 
However, inlining can also increase the size of the executable code, which can lead to increased memory usage.

Why is inlining important for game development?

Game development often involves writing code that needs to be executed in real time. 
This means that developers need to be able to write code that is fast and efficient, while also being easy to read and maintain. 
Inlining is an important technique for optimizing game code, since it can significantly reduce the overhead associated with function calls.

By using the FORCEINLINE macro in Unreal Engine, developers can suggest to the compiler that a particular function should be inlined. 
This can result in faster code execution, which is important for games that need to render graphics, simulate physics, and handle player input in real time.

How does the FORCEINLINE macro work?

The FORCEINLINE macro is used to suggest to the compiler that a particular function should be inlined. 
When a function is declared using the FORCEINLINE macro, the compiler will attempt to inline the function whenever it is called.




Here's an example of how the FORCEINLINE macro can be used in Unreal Engine:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
FORCEINLINE float Square(float X)
{
    return X * X;
}
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
In this example, the Square function is defined using the FORCEINLINE macro, which suggests to the compiler that the function should be inlined if possible. 
This can result in faster code execution when the Square function is called.

Best practices for using the FORCEINLINE macro
Here are some best practices for using the FORCEINLINE macro in Unreal Engine:

Use the FORCEINLINE macro only for small functions that are called frequently.
Large functions are unlikely to benefit from inlining and may result in increased code size.
Don't use the FORCEINLINE macro for functions with complex control flow or error handling.
Inlining these functions may result in increased code size and reduced performance.
Use the FORCEINLINE macro sparingly. Overuse of the FORCEINLINE macro can result in increased code size and decreased maintainability.

Example usage
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// MyActor.h

#pragma once

#include "CoreMinimal.h"
#include "GameFramework/Actor.h"
#include "MyActor.generated.h"

UCLASS()
class AMyActor : public AActor
{
	GENERATED_BODY()

public:
	AMyActor();

protected:
	virtual void BeginPlay() override;

private:
	FORCEINLINE float CalculateDamage(float BaseDamage, float Armor) const;
};
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


In this example, we have a custom actor class AMyActor, which has a private function CalculateDamage. 
We have defined the CalculateDamage function using the FORCEINLINE macro, which suggests to the compiler that this function should be inlined whenever it is called.

By inlining the CalculateDamage function, we can reduce the overhead associated with function calls and improve the performance of our code. 
This can be particularly useful in game development, where even small optimizations can make a big difference in the overall performance of the game.

Note that we have marked the CalculateDamage function as const, which means that it does not modify the state of the object.
This is a good practice to follow when using the FORCEINLINE macro, as inlining a function that modifies the state of an object can result in unexpected behavior.



Here's an example implementation of the CalculateDamage function:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// MyActor.cpp

#include "MyActor.h"

AMyActor::AMyActor()
{
}

void AMyActor::BeginPlay()
{
    float BaseDamage = 100.f;
    float Armor = 50.f;
    float DamageDealt = CalculateDamage(BaseDamage, Armor);
    UE_LOG(LogTemp, Warning, TEXT("Damage dealt: %f"), DamageDealt);
}

FORCEINLINE float AMyActor::CalculateDamage(float BaseDamage, float Armor) const
{
    float DamageMultiplier = FMath::Max(0.f, 1.f - Armor / 100.f);
    return BaseDamage * DamageMultiplier;
}
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In this implementation, we use the CalculateDamage function to calculate the amount of damage dealt to an object, based on a base damage value and an armor value. 
The CalculateDamage function uses the FMath::Max function to ensure that the damage multiplier is always at least 0, 
and then returns the product of the base damage and the damage multiplier.

By inlining the CalculateDamage function, we can avoid the overhead associated with function calls and improve the performance of our code.
This can be particularly useful in game development, where performance is critical to a smooth player experience.
