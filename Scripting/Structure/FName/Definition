In Unreal Engine, FName is a struct used to represent a name or identifier.
It is used extensively throughout the engine, particularly in areas like gameplay tags and networking.

Here are some key points to keep in mind about FName:

* FName objects are immutable, meaning once they are created they cannot be changed.
* FName is very lightweight, and can be compared and assigned very quickly.
* FName objects are automatically pooled and reused, which helps reduce memory usage and improve performance.
* You can create an FName object using the FName() constructor, passing in a const TCHAR* string as the parameter.
* You can get the string representation of an FName object using the ToString() method.
* FName objects are often used as keys in maps and other data structures, because they provide a fast and efficient way to look up and compare objects.

An example of how you might use FName in code:
------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Create a new FName object
FName MyName("MyName");

// Get the string representation of the FName object
FString MyString = MyName.ToString();

// Use the FName object as a key in a map
TMap<FName, int32> MyMap;
MyMap.Add(MyName, 42);
------------------------------------------------------------------------
