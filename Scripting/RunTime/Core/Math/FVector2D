FVector2D is a struct used to represent a two-dimensional vector. It's commonly employed for tasks that involve 2D space, such as UI layout, screen coordinates, texture mapping, and more.
The struct comprises two floating-point components: X and Y.

Here's the declaration of the FVector2D struct:
struct FVector2D
{
    float X;
    float Y;
};

X, Y: These components represent the vector's position or direction along the horizontal (X) and vertical (Y) axes, respectively.
Here are some common use cases and examples of how FVector2D can be used in Unreal Engine C++:

Example 1: Screen Position
FVector2D ScreenPosition(100.0f, 50.0f); // Represents a position at (100, 50) on the screen

Example 2: Size of a UI Element
FVector2D ElementSize(200.0f, 100.0f); // Represents the size of a UI element with width 200 and height 100

Example 3: Texture UV Coordinates
FVector2D TextureUV(0.5f, 0.25f); // Represents UV coordinates for mapping a texture

Example 4: Arithmetic Operations on FVector2D
FVector2D A(1.0f, 2.0f);
FVector2D B(3.0f, 4.0f);

FVector2D Result = A + B; // Component-wise addition
// Result.X = 1.0f + 3.0f = 4.0f
// Result.Y = 2.0f + 4.0f = 6.0f

FVector2D Scaled = A * 2.0f; // Scalar multiplication
// Scaled.X = 1.0f * 2.0f = 2.0f
// Scaled.Y = 2.0f * 2.0f = 4.0f

Example 5: Normalized Vector
FVector2D Direction(3.0f, 4.0f);
Direction.Normalize(); // Normalize the vector to have unit length

// Direction.X = 3.0f / 5.0f = 0.6f
// Direction.Y = 4.0f / 5.0f = 0.8f
These examples illustrate how FVector2D can be utilized in Unreal Engine C++ to manage various 2D data and perform operations such as addition, multiplication, and normalization. 
It's a fundamental component for implementing 2D functionality within the engine, including user interfaces, sprite animations, and 2D game logic.
