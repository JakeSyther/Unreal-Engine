* Finding the nearest enemy to the player:

TArray<AEnemy*> Enemies;
AEnemy* NearestEnemy = nullptr;
float NearestDistanceSquared = MAX_FLT;
for (AEnemy* Enemy : Enemies)
{
    float DistanceSquared = (Enemy->GetActorLocation() - Player->GetActorLocation()).SizeSquared();
    if (DistanceSquared < NearestDistanceSquared)
    {
        NearestEnemy = Enemy;
        NearestDistanceSquared = DistanceSquared;
    }
}


In this example, Find() is not used directly, but rather a custom algorithm is used to iterate through the array of enemies and find the one closest to the player.
The * symbol in AEnemy* indicates that these are pointers to objects of the AEnemy class, and MAX_FLT is a constant that represents 
the maximum value of a floating point number.



* Finding a specific item in a player's inventory:

TArray<AItem*> Inventory;
AItem* FoundItem = Inventory.FindByPredicate([](const AItem* Item) {
    return Item->GetName() == "Key"; // Assume there is an item named "Key"
});
if (FoundItem)
{
    // Use the found item
}
In this example, Find() is used with a predicate function to search the array of items for one with a specific name. 
The [] syntax is used to define a lambda function that takes a const pointer to an AItem object, and returns a boolean value indicating whether
the item's name matches the desired name. If a matching item is found, a pointer to it is returned and stored in FoundItem. If no matching item is found, 
FoundItem will be nullptr.


* Finding a projectile that has collided with an object:

TArray<AProjectile*> Projectiles;
AProjectile* CollidedProjectile = Projectiles.FindByPredicate([](const AProjectile* Projectile) {
    return Projectile->HasCollided(); // Assume AProjectile has a HasCollided() function
});
if (CollidedProjectile)
{
    // Handle the collided projectile
}

In this example, Find() is used with a predicate function to search the array of projectiles for one that has collided with another object. 
The [] syntax is used to define a lambda function that takes a const pointer to an AProjectile object,
and returns a boolean value indicating whether the projectile has collided. If a matching projectile is found,
a pointer to it is returned and stored in CollidedProjectile. If no matching projectile is found, CollidedProjectile will be nullptr.
