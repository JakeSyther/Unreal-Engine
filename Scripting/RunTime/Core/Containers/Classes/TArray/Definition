"Templated dynamic array"

TArray is a templated dynamic array class in Unreal Engine that provides a flexible and efficient way to store and manipulate collections of elements of the same type.
It is commonly used for storing and manipulating data in game development, such as storing the positions of game objects or managing a player's inventory.

To use TArray, you need to declare an instance of the class and specify the type of element that you want to store.



Here's an example:

TArray<int> MyIntArray;

In this example, we have declared an instance of TArray called MyIntArray that stores integer values.

TArray provides a number of useful functions for adding, removing, and manipulating elements in the array. 



Here are some examples:

Add() - adds a new element to the end of the array.
MyIntArray.Add(5);


Remove() - removes an element from the array by its index.
MyIntArray.Remove(2); // Removes the element at index 2

Insert() - inserts a new element at a specific index in the array.
MyIntArray.Insert(10, 2); // Inserts the value 10 at index 2


Find() - searches the array for a specific element and returns its index.
int Index = MyIntArray.Find(5); // Returns the index of the first occurrence of the value 5


Sort() - sorts the elements in the array in ascending order
MyIntArray.Sort();


Num() - returns the number of elements in the array.
int NumElements = MyIntArray.Num();

TArray also provides a variety of functions for manipulating the array's memory allocation, 
such as Reserve() to preallocate memory for a certain number of elements, and Shrink() to release any unused memory.

One important thing to note about TArray is that it is a dynamic array, which means that its size can be changed at runtime. 
However, this flexibility comes at the cost of performance, as resizing the array can be an expensive operation.
To avoid unnecessary memory reallocations and improve performance, it is a good practice to preallocate the array's memory using the Reserve() 
function if you know the maximum number of elements that the array will need to store.
