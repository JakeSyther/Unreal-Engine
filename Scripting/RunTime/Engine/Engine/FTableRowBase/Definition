FTableRowBase is a class in Unreal Engine C++ that is used to define structured data for use in table row data assets.
These assets are commonly used in game development to store configuration data, level data, and user interface data.

FTableRowBase is an abstract base class, meaning it cannot be directly instantiated. 
Instead, it is designed to be subclassed to create custom table row classes that define structured data for a specific purpose. 
These subclasses can define their own data members and methods to provide functionality specific to the table row data they represent.

The FTableRowBase class provides several functions and members that are used to work with table row data assets. 

These include:

Serialize : This function serializes the data in the table row asset to and from disk. It is used to save and load table row data assets.

RowName   : This member stores the name of the table row asset. It is used to identify the asset in the Unreal Editor's table view.

IsStale   : This member indicates whether the table row asset has been modified since it was last saved.
            It is used to determine whether the asset needs to be saved before the game is run.

When creating a table row data asset, a custom subclass of FTableRowBase is used as the base class.
The custom subclass defines the data members and default values for the table row data. 
The data can then be edited in the Unreal Editor's table view, and the resulting asset can be used in the game code to access the structured data.

FTableRowBase is commonly used in game development to store configuration data, such as settings for character abilities, weapon properties, and enemy behavior.
It is also used to define structured level data, such as spawn points, objective locations, and enemy placement. 
Additionally, FTableRowBase can be used to define data structures for user interface elements, such as menus and inventory screens.

In summary, FTableRowBase is an abstract base class in Unreal Engine C++ that is used to define structured data for table row data assets. 
It provides several functions and members for working with table row data assets, and is commonly used in game development to store configuration data, level data,
and user interface data.
