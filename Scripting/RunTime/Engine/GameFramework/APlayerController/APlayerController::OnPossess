APlayerController::OnPossess is a function in Unreal Engine that is called when a player controller possesses a pawn.
When a player controller takes control of a pawn, it becomes the "possessor" of that pawn, and OnPossess is called on the player controller.

Here's an example of how OnPossess might be used in a game:

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                // MyPlayerController.h
#pragma once

#include "CoreMinimal.h"
#include "GameFramework/PlayerController.h"
#include "MyPlayerController.generated.h"

UCLASS()
class MYGAME_API AMyPlayerController : public APlayerController
{
    GENERATED_BODY()

public:
    virtual void OnPossess(APawn* InPawn) override;
};




                // MyPlayerController.cpp
#include "MyPlayerController.h"
#include "MyCharacter.h" // Assuming you have a custom character class called MyCharacter

void AMyPlayerController::OnPossess(APawn* InPawn)
{
    Super::OnPossess(InPawn);

    // Check if the possessed pawn is a MyCharacter
    AMyCharacter* MyChar = Cast<AMyCharacter>(InPawn);
    if (MyChar != nullptr)
    {
        // If it is, do something with it
        MyChar->DoSomething();
    }
}
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In this example, we have a custom player controller class called AMyPlayerController. It inherits from APlayerController, and overrides the OnPossess function.

In the OnPossess function, we call Super::OnPossess to perform any necessary setup that the parent class needs to do.

Then, we check if the pawn that was just possessed is a MyCharacter (which is a custom character class we've created). 
We do this by using the Cast function, which attempts to cast InPawn to an AMyCharacter.
If the cast is successful, MyChar will be a pointer to the possessed pawn, and we can call functions on it.

Finally, we call MyChar->DoSomething() to do some custom action on the possessed character.
