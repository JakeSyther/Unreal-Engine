PostInitializeComponents() is a virtual function of the AActor class that is called after all of the actor's components have been created and initialized. 
It is called during the actor's initialization process and can be overridden by derived classes to perform additional setup and initialization tasks.

The purpose of PostInitializeComponents() is to provide a hook for actors to perform any additional setup and initialization tasks 
that require the components to be fully initialized. 

For example, an actor might use this function to set up references to other components, initialize component properties that depend on other components,
or perform other tasks that require all components to be initialized.


Example implementation of PostInitializeComponents() in C++:

----------------------------------------------------------------
void AMyActor::PostInitializeComponents()
{
    Super::PostInitializeComponents();

    // Perform additional initialization tasks here...
}
----------------------------------------------------------------

It is important to note that PostInitializeComponents() is called once during the actor's lifetime, after all of the components have been created and initialized.
Therefore, any setup or initialization tasks that need to be performed every frame should be done in the Tick() function, rather than in PostInitializeComponents().
