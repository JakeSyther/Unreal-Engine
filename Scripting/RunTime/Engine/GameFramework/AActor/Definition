In Unreal Engine, AActor is a fundamental class that represents any object that can be placed or spawned in the game world.
All interactive elements, characters, props, lights, cameras, and more in a UE5 game are instances of AActor or its subclasses. 
The AActor class is part of the engine's gameplay framework and provides a wide range of functionalities 
that make it a cornerstone for building game objects.

Here's a basic overview of the AActor class:

Class Hierarchy: AActor is the base class for all actors in the engine. 
It is derived from UObject and is the parent class for many other classes, such as APawn, ACharacter, AStaticMeshActor, and more.

Key Features:

Transform: AActor has a FTransform property that represents its location, rotation, and scale in the game world.
Components: Actors can have multiple components attached to them, like USceneComponent, UStaticMeshComponent, UCameraComponent, etc.,
which define their visual representation, collision, behavior, and other aspects.
Lifecycle Events: Actors have functions for various lifecycle events, such as BeginPlay (called when the actor is spawned),
Tick (called every frame), and EndPlay (called when the actor is destroyed).

Here's a simple example of an AActor subclass in C++:

// MyActor.h
#pragma once

#include "CoreMinimal.h"
#include "GameFramework/Actor.h"
#include "MyActor.generated.h"

UCLASS()
class MYPROJECT_API AMyActor : public AActor
{
    GENERATED_BODY()

public:

    // Sets default values for this actor's properties
    AMyActor();

protected:

    // Called when the game starts or when spawned
    virtual void BeginPlay() override;

    // Called every frame
    virtual void Tick(float DeltaTime) override;

private:

    // Declare any private variables or functions here
};

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// MyActor.cpp

#include "MyActor.h"

// Sets default values
AMyActor::AMyActor()
{
    // Set this actor to call Tick() every frame
    PrimaryActorTick.bCanEverTick = true;
}

// Called when the game starts or when spawned
void AMyActor::BeginPlay()
{
    Super::BeginPlay();

    // Add initialization code here
}

// Called every frame
void AMyActor::Tick(float DeltaTime)
{
    Super::Tick(DeltaTime);

    // Add per-frame update code here
}
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


In this example, AMyActor is a custom subclass of AActor. You can add any functionality specific to your actor in this class.
The BeginPlay function is called when the actor is spawned, and the Tick function is called every frame.

To use this actor in your game, you can place it in the level using the editor or spawn it dynamically in C++ code. For example:


AMyActor* MyNewActor = GetWorld()->SpawnActor<AMyActor>(SpawnLocation, SpawnRotation);

This line of code spawns an instance of AMyActor at the specified location and rotation in the game world.
