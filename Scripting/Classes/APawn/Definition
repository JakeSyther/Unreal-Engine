APawn is a base class in Unreal Engine that represents the player or any other entity that can be controlled by a player or AI.
It provides basic functionality such as movement and collision detection, and is meant to be extended by subclasses for more specialized behavior.

Some key features of APawn include:

* A movement component, which handles the physics and movement of the pawn.
* An input component, which handles input from the player or AI.
* A collision component, which detects collisions with other objects in the game world.

When creating a new pawn, you typically create a subclass of APawn and add functionality specific to your game.
For example, you might add a weapon system or AI behavior.
