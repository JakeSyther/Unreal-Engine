"AddMovementInput" is a method provided by the "ACharacter" and "APawn" classes in Unreal Engine. 
It allows you to add movement input to the controlled character or pawn.

Here's some information about AddMovementInput:

The method takes a FVector parameter which represents the direction and magnitude of the movement input.
The input vector is in the local space of the pawn or character.
The input is multiplied by the MaxAcceleration parameter of the character or pawn, so the magnitude of the input vector should be between 0 and 1.
The resulting acceleration is added to the current velocity of the character or pawn.

"AddMovementInput" can be useful in a variety of situations, such as implementing movement with WASD or arrow keys, 
or for moving characters in response to game events like explosions or knockback.

In the Unreal Engine hierarchy, AddMovementInput is located in the ACharacter and APawn classes, which are both subclasses of AActor.
You can find the documentation for AddMovementInput in the Unreal Engine API documentation for ACharacter and APawn.

Remember, it's always a good idea to read and understand the documentation thoroughly before using any method or class in Unreal Engine. 
Additionally, make sure to use best practices and adhere to the programming standards and conventions for the engine to ensure your code is optimized and maintainable.
