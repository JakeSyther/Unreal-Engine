UObject is the base class of all Unreal Engine objects.
It provides fundamental features such as object serialization, garbage collection, reflection, and networking. 
Every object in UE4 is an instance of UObject or its subclass.

UObject provides a number of useful functions such as:

* GetName() and GetFullName() to get the name and full path of the object
* Set/GetProperty() to set and get a named property value
* FindObject() to search for an object by name and/or class
* LoadObject() to load an object from a package
* Serialize() to save and load the object to and from an archive

UObject can be used in a variety of ways, such as creating a new custom class that derives from UObject,
or using existing classes that derive fromUObject such as Actor, Component, and Widget.

UObject is located in the UObject.h header file and is included in many other headers throughout the engine.


Example:
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Custom UObject class header
#pragma once

#include "CoreMinimal.h"
#include "UObject/Object.h"
#include "MyUObject.generated.h"

UCLASS()
class MYPROJECT_API UMyUObject : public UObject
{
    GENERATED_BODY()

public:
    // Constructor
    UMyUObject();

    // Public variable
    UPROPERTY(EditAnywhere, BlueprintReadWrite, Category="My UObject")
    int32 MyInt;
};

// Custom UObject class implementation
#include "MyUObject.h"

UMyUObject::UMyUObject()
{
    // Set default values
    MyInt = 0;
}

It's important to understand the concept of objects in UE5 and their relationship to the game engine.
Make sure to read the documentation thoroughly and practice creating and using custom UObject classes to get familiar with the concepts. 
Additionally, consider the memory management implications when working with UObject-derived classes as they are managed by the garbage collector.
