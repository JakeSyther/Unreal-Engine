The FMath::GetMappedRangeValueClamped() function is a utility method provided by the FMath class in Unreal Engine.
It is used to map a value from one range to another, while also clamping the result within a specified range.

The function takes five parameters:

1. Value: The input value that needs to be mapped to a new range.
2. InRangeA: The minimum value of the input range.
3. InRangeB: The maximum value of the input range.
4. OutRangeA: The minimum value of the output range.
5. OutRangeB: The maximum value of the output range.

The purpose of GetMappedRangeValueClamped() is to take the Value and linearly map it from the input range (InRangeA to InRangeB) to the output range 
(OutRangeA to OutRangeB), while ensuring that the result is clamped within the output range. 
Clamping means that if the mapped value falls outside the output range, it will be "clamped" to the nearest boundary value of the output range.


An example to illustrate how the function works:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
float InputValue = 0.75f;  // Input value within the input range

float InputRangeMin = 0.0f;
float InputRangeMax = 1.0f;

float OutputRangeMin = 10.0f;
float OutputRangeMax = 20.0f;

float MappedValue = FMath::GetMappedRangeValueClamped(InputValue, InputRangeMin, InputRangeMax, OutputRangeMin, OutputRangeMax);
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In this example, the InputValue is 0.75, which falls within the input range of 0.0 to 1.0. The desired output range is 10.0 to 20.0.

The GetMappedRangeValueClamped() function will map the InputValue from the input range to the output range using linear interpolation.
Since the InputValue of 0.75 falls three-quarters of the way between the input range's minimum and maximum,
the mapped value will also be three-quarters of the way between the output range's minimum and maximum.

The resulting MappedValue will be 17.5, which is the mapped value of 0.75 within the output range of 10.0 to 20.0.

If the input value were outside the input range, the function would still map it to the output range but clamp it within the boundaries. 
For example, if the InputValue were 1.5, which is outside the input range of 0.0 to 1.0, the function would still map it to the output range 
but clamp it to the maximum value of 20.0, resulting in a MappedValue of 20.0.

Overall, FMath::GetMappedRangeValueClamped() is a helpful utility method for mapping a value from one range to another while ensuring the result 
is clamped within a specified range. It is commonly used in game development and computer graphics to remap values such as input from a controller or mouse 
to appropriate ranges for game mechanics or visual effects.
