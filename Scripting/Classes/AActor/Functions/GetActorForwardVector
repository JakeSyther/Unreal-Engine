GetActorForwardVector is a function in Unreal Engine that returns the forward vector of an actor, which is the direction it is facing in local space.
The forward vector is a normalized 3D vector that points in the direction that the actor is facing.

This function is a member of the AActor class, which is the base class for all actors in Unreal Engine.
It can be used to get the forward vector of any actor in the game, including the player's character and non-playable characters.

An example of how to use GetActorForwardVector:

// Get the forward vector of an actor
AActor* MyActor       = GetWorld()->GetFirstPlayerController()->GetPawn();
FVector ForwardVector = MyActor->GetActorForwardVector();


This code gets the first player controller's pawn from the game world, which is an actor that represents the player character.
It then gets the forward vector of the pawn using GetActorForwardVector and stores it in a FVector variable called ForwardVector.

GetActorForwardVector can be found in the AActor class, which is located at the top of the Unreal Engine class hierarchy.
The AActor class is the parent class for many other classes in the engine, including APawn, ACharacter, AStaticMeshActor, and many more.

Official documentation for GetActorForwardVector can be found on the 
Unreal Engine website here: https://docs.unrealengine.com/en-US/API/Runtime/Engine/GameFramework/AActor/GetActorForwardVector/index.html

Remember to always consult the official documentation when using Unreal Engine functions and classes, as it contains the most up-to-date and accurate information.


Here's an another example of how to use GetActorForwardVector...

Let's say you have a APawn class and you want to move it forward in the direction it's facing. 
You can use GetActorForwardVector to get the forward direction vector of the pawn and then multiply it by a movement speed to move the pawn in that direction.

How to do that:

void AMovementPawn::MoveForward(float Value)
{
    FVector Direction = GetActorForwardVector();
    AddMovementInput(Direction, Value);
}

In this example, MoveForward is a function that takes a float Value as a parameter. 
This value represents the input from the player (e.g. from a keyboard or gamepad).

The function gets the forward direction vector of the pawn using GetActorForwardVector and stores it in the Direction variable.
It then calls the AddMovementInput function to add movement input in the Direction vector multiplied by the Value parameter.
