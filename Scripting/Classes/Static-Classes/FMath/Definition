FMath is a static class in Unreal Engine that provides a range of math functions for use in game development.
Some of the key features of FMath include:

* Basic math functions such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division
* Trigonometric functions such as sine, cosine, and tangent
* Exponential and logarithmic functions
* Random number generation
* Vector and matrix operations, such as dot product, cross product, and matrix multiplication
* Conversion functions for converting between degrees and radians

FMath is commonly used in game development to perform calculations related to game physics, collision detection, and AI. 
It can also be used for a wide range of other purposes such as procedural content generation, data analysis, and more.

Some of the most commonly used properties of FMath in Unreal Engine:

PI                  : A float constant representing the mathematical constant pi (3.14159265359...).
HALF_PI             : A float constant representing half of pi (1.57079632679...).
DELTA               : A small float value used for comparisons, generally set to 0.00001.
SMALL_NUMBER        : A small float value used for comparisons, generally set to 0.0001.
KINDA_SMALL_NUMBER  : A small float value used for comparisons, generally set to 0.001.
BIG_NUMBER          : A large float value used for comparisons, generally set to 3.4e+38.
EULERS_NUMBER       : A float constant representing the mathematical constant e (2.71828182845...).
MAX_uint8           : The maximum value for an unsigned 8-bit integer (255).
MAX_int32           : The maximum value for a signed 32-bit integer (2147483647).
MIN_int32           : The minimum value for a signed 32-bit integer (-2147483648).
