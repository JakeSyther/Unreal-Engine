UStaticMeshComponent is a component class in Unreal Engine that allows you to add a static mesh to an actor. 
A static mesh is a 3D object that does not have any animation or skeletal structure, 
and is typically used for environmental or architectural elements in a game or simulation.

Some of the key features and properties of UStaticMeshComponent:

* Mesh      : The static mesh that the component uses.
* Materials : The materials that are applied to the mesh. These can be set per-instance or globally for the entire mesh.
* Collision : The collision settings for the mesh, including whether it has collision enabled, its collision profile, and its physics properties.
* LODs      : The level-of-detail settings for the mesh, including which meshes to use at different distances from the camera.
* Lighting  : The lighting settings for the mesh, including whether it casts shadows and how it interacts with various types of lights.
* Transform : The position, rotation, and scale of the component within its parent actor's coordinate space.
* Visibility: Whether the component is currently visible, and whether it should be hidden in certain circumstances (such as when the player is too far away).


UStaticMeshComponent also has a number of functions and events that allow you to interact with it in various ways. 

For example, you can use functions like SetStaticMesh() to change the mesh that the component is using, or events like OnComponentHit() to respond
to collisions with other objects in the game world.

Overall, UStaticMeshComponent is a versatile and powerful tool that allows you to add 3D objects to your game or simulation with ease.
