UCameraComponent is a class in Unreal Engine that represents a camera object in a game. 
It allows you to control the position, orientation, and field of view of the camera in the game world.

The UCameraComponent is typically added as a component to an AActor-derived class (e.g. APawn) to provide a way to visualize 
and interact with the game world from a particular perspective. It is located under the "Camera" section in the "Add Component" menu in the Unreal Editor.

An example of how to create and set up a UCameraComponent in code:

// Create a UCameraComponent and attach it to an AActor-derived class
UCameraComponent* CameraComponent = CreateDefaultSubobject<UCameraComponent>(TEXT("Camera"));
CameraComponent->SetupAttachment(RootComponent);

// Set the position and orientation of the camera
CameraComponent->SetRelativeLocation(FVector(0.f, 0.f, 50.f));
CameraComponent->SetRelativeRotation(FRotator(-45.f, 0.f, 0.f));

// Set the field of view of the camera
CameraComponent->SetFieldOfView(90.f);

In this example, we create a new UCameraComponent and attach it to the RootComponent of an AActor-derived class.
We then set the position and orientation of the camera and adjust the field of view.

Here is the link to the official documentation for UCameraComponent:

My advice to you is to experiment with the various properties of the UCameraComponent in the Unreal Editor and in code to get a feel for how it works.
Remember to also consider the performance impact of your camera settings, as the camera can be a major contributor to the workload of the game engine.
